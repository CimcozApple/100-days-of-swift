# Day 34: _Project 7: Whitehouse Petitions_, Part Two

## üìí Field Notes

This day covers the second part of `Project 7: Whitehouse Petitions` in _[Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/7)_.

You can find the entire project I made to follow along in the folder of Day 33, but Day 34, in particular, focuses on several specific topics:

- Rendering a petition: `loadHTMLString`
- Finishing touches: `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`


### Rendering a petition: `loadHTMLString`

During our initial introduction to `WKWebView`, I was wondering whether or not there were still any compelling use cases for it now that `SFSafariViewController` has been introduced. `WKWebView.loadHTMLString` might be one example.

If we have some kind of dynamic HTML string that we want to use for rendering, this method can give us a style of creating our own views that `SFSafariViewController` doesn't offer. Our current app is a bit of a toy example &mdash; I'd probably create a custom, native UI and feed our petition data to its various elements &mdash; but it serves as a solid proof of concept. I can imagine a scenario where an API _only_ returns HTML. And in that case, we could feed it straight in to `loadHTMLString` (perhaps after also checking for malicious script injections üëÆ‚Äç).


### Finishing touches: `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`

One of the first hooks generated in a project's `AppDelegate.swift` file, `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` is where we can perform set-up operations for our app when we know that it's _just_ about to start running.

And that's the perfect place for configuring our `UITabBarController`, wiring up the two child view controllers we need it to manage.

```swift
if let tabBarController = window?.rootViewController as? UITabBarController {
    let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil)
    let navController = storyboard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "Petitions Nav Controller")

    navController.tabBarItem = UITabBarItem(tabBarSystemItem: .topRated, tag: 1)
    tabBarController.viewControllers?.append(navController)
}
```

In some cases, a storyboard might do, but on the scale of storyboard to code, the fact that our tab bar's two view stacks are pretty much identical pushes tips things towards the latter ‚öñÔ∏è.

#### Configuring the API URL

Our two view controllers do have on _minor_ difference: their API URLs. One way to handle this is to have the view controller check its position within the tab par and infer which URL it should use:

```swift
if navigationController?.tabBarItem.tag == 0 {
    apiURLString = "https://api.whitehouse.gov/v1/petitions.json?limit=100"
} else {
    apiURLString = "https://api.whitehouse.gov/v1/petitions.json?signatureCountFloor=10000&limit=100"
}
```

I prefer a more top-down approach, though. Rather than making the petitions view controller aware of our tab-bar designs, we can store our API urls in an `enum`, and then have our code in `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` decide which controllers get to use which URLs. Iterating on the earlier `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` example, I came up with this:

```swift
if let tabBarController = window?.rootViewController as? UITabBarController {
    let storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil)
    let navController = storyboard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: StoryboardId.petitionsNavController)
    let petitionsViewController = navController.children.first as? PetitionsListViewController

    petitionsViewController?.apiURLString = PetitionsAPI.popularPetitions
    navController.tabBarItem = UITabBarItem(tabBarSystemItem: .topRated, tag: 1)
    tabBarController.viewControllers?.append(navController)
}
```

(Only one modification is used here, because I _did_ leave the `PetitionsAPI.popularPetitions` as the default for the `PetitionsListViewController`).
