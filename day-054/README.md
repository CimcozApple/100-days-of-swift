# Day 54: _Project 13: Instafilter_, Part Three

_Follow along at https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/54_.


## ðŸ“’ Field Notes

> This day covers the third and final part of `Project 13: Instafilter` in _[Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/13)_.
>
> I previously created projects alongside the material in the book in a [separate repository](https://github.com/CypherPoet/book--hacking-with-swift). And you can find Project 13 [here](https://github.com/CypherPoet/book--hacking-with-swift/tree/master/13-instafilter). Even better, though, I copied it over to Day 52's folder so I could extend it from where I left off.
>
> With that in mind, Day 54 focuses on extending the project according to a set of challenges.


## ðŸ¥… Challenges

### Challenge 1

> Try making the Save button show an error if there was no image in the image view.

    + I took a slightly different approach and made the save button disabled until an image was present ðŸ™‚.


### Challenge 2

> Make the Change Filter button change its title to show the name of the currently selected filter.

### Challenge 3

> Experiment with having more than one slider, to control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.
