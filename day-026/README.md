# Day 26: Project 4, Part Three

_Follow along at https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/26_.

## ðŸ“’ Field Notes

This day covers the final part of `Project 4, Easy Browser` in _[Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/4/overview)_.

I have a [separate repository](https://github.com/CypherPoet/book--hacking-with-swift) where I've been creating projects alongside the material in the book. However, I've also been tweaking the project further while going through the 100 Day challenge, and you can find _that_ version of it in this directory.

With that in mind, the main focus of this day was extending the finished app according to a set of challenges.

## ðŸ¥… Challenges

### Challenge 1

> If users try to visit a URL that isnâ€™t allowed, show an alert saying itâ€™s blocked.

### Challenge 2

> Try making two new toolbar items with the titles Back and Forward. You should make them use   `webView.goBack` and `webView.goForward`.

### Challenge 3

> For more of a challenge, try changing the initial view controller to a table view like in project 1, where users can choose their website from a list rather than just having the first in the array loaded up front.
