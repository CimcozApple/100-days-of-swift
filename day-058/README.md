# Day 58: _Project 15: Animation_, Part Two

_Follow along at https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/58_.


## ðŸ“’ Field Notes

> This day covers the first part of `Project 15: Animation` in _[Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/15)_.
>
> I previously created projects alongside _Hacking with Swift_ in a [separate repository](https://github.com/CypherPoet/book--hacking-with-swift), and you can find Project 15 [here](https://github.com/CypherPoet/book--hacking-with-swift/tree/master/15-animation/animation). Even better, though, I copied it over to Day 57's folder so I could extend it for _100 Days of Swift_.
>
> With that in mind, Day 58 focuses on extending Project 15's material with a set of challenges.


## ðŸ¥… Challenges

### Challenge 1

> Go back to project 8 and make the letter group buttons fade out when they are tapped. We were using the isHidden property, but you'll need to switch to alpha because isHidden is either true or false, it has no animatable values between.

### Challenge 2

> Go back to project 13 and make the image view fade in when a new picture is chosen. To make this work, set the alpha to 0 first.
