## ðŸ“’ Field Notes

This day covers the third and final part of `Project 7: Whitehouse Petitions` in _[Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/7)_.

You can find the entire project I made to follow along in the folder of Day 33, but Day 35, in particular, focuses extending the project according a set of challenges.


## ðŸ¥… Challenges

### Challenge 1

> Add a Credits button to the top-right corner using UIBarButtonItem. When this is tapped, show an alert telling users the data comes from the We The People API of the Whitehouse.

### Challenge 2

> Let users filter the petitions they see. This involves creating a second array of filtered items that contains only petitions matching a string the user entered. Use a UIAlertController with a text field to let them enter that string.
