# Day 61: _Project 16: Capital Cities_, Part Two

_Follow along at https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/61_.


## ðŸ“’ Field Notes

> This day covers the second and final part of `Project 16: Capital Cities` in _[Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/16)_.
>
> I previously created projects alongside _Hacking with Swift_ in a [separate repository](https://github.com/CypherPoet/book--hacking-with-swift), and you can find Project 16 [here](https://github.com/CypherPoet/book--hacking-with-swift/tree/master/19-capital-cities/Capital%20Cities). Even better, though, I copied it over to Day 60's folder so I could extend it for _100 Days of Swift_.
>
> With that in mind, Day 61 focuses on extending the project with a set of challenges.


## ðŸ¥… Challenges


### Challenge 1

> Try typecasting the return value from `dequeueReusableAnnotationView()` so that it's an `MKPinAnnotationView`. Once thatâ€™s done, change the `pinTintColor` property to your favorite UIColor.

### Challenge 2

> Add a `UIAlertController` that lets users specify how they want to view the map. There's a `mapType` property that draws the maps in different ways. For example, `.satellite` gives a satellite view of the terrain.

### Challenge 3

> Modify the callout button so that pressing it shows a new view controller with a web view, taking users to the Wikipedia entry for that city.
