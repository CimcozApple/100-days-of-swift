# Day 63: _Project 17: Space Race_, Part Two

_Follow along at https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/63_.


## ðŸ“’ Field Notes

> This day covers the second and final part of `Project 17: Space Race` in _[Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/17)_.
>
> I previously created projects alongside _Hacking with Swift_ in a [separate repository](https://github.com/CypherPoet/book--hacking-with-swift), and you can find Project 17 [here](https://github.com/CypherPoet/book--hacking-with-swift/tree/master/23-space-race). Even better, though, I copied it over to Day 62's folder so I could extend it for _100 Days of Swift_.
>
> With that in mind, Day 63 focuses on extending the project with a set of challenges.


## ðŸ¥… Challenges

### Challenge 1

> Stop the player from cheating by lifting their finger and tapping elsewhere â€“ try implementing `touchesEnded()` to make it work.

- ðŸ”— [Commit](https://github.com/CypherPoet/100-days-of-swift/commit/eecdd7eee4a418acde27f69cade883c0db91f0bf)


### Challenge 2

> Make the timer start at one second, but then, after 20 enemies have been made, subtract 0.1 seconds from it so itâ€™s triggered every 0.9 seconds. After making 20 more, subtract another 0.1, and so on. Note: you should call `invalidate()` on `gameTimer` before giving it a new value, otherwise you end up with multiple timers.

### Challenge 3

> Stop creating space debris after the player has died.
