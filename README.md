# 100 Days of Swift

## üëã Introduction

This project is meant to follow along with [Paul Hudson‚Äôs 100 Day‚Äôs of Swift challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100). There are many 100 Days of Swift challenges out there in the wild, but Paul is one of the best contributors to education that the Swift community has, and when I saw him [throw down the gauntlet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB5nWzdl-b8), I couldn‚Äôt resist taking part.

As the first day of this endeavor, a brief introduction is in order. I‚Äôve been learning Swift and iOS development for a few months now after 5 years as a (mostly) front-end web (re: JavaScript üòê) developer who has decided to take the leap into native ‚Äî thus, diving into the wonderful world of Swift, iOS, macOS, server-side Swift, and beyond.

As an unabashed polyglot who‚Äôs played with everything from JavaScript and Python to Java and CPP, Swift has been love at first line of code. While this is a topic that deserves a much larger write-up, I _will_ say that Swift, in many ways, feels like a culmination for me ‚Äî the kind of language I‚Äôve wanted to write in for quite some time. With that in mind, I‚Äôm actually planning on Infinity days of Swift. But that‚Äôs neither here nor there: The people want 100, so I'll do my best to provide something valuable within those parameters.

Each "day" folder will contain a write-up where I'll recap the material covered, while also trying to interject my own insight, opinions, and reflections on how I'm learning and growing. Furthermore, when possible, I‚Äôll try to include any code that was written along the way, links to relevant articles and information that I find online -- basically, whatever I can think of that's useful and relevant.

## Contributing

Feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated. I'll be opening up [issues](https://github.com/CypherPoet/100-days-of-swift/issues) to serve as discussion threads for each day. But feel free to open up your own as well.
